# Udiddit_A_Social_News_Aggregator
## Second project from SQL nanodegree by Udacity
Investigated a poorly designed database for Udiddit, a social news aggregator.  

The goal of this project was to take an existing database schema filled with data and perform the following tasks:
* Create a new database schema that normalizes the data
* Use DML/DQL to migrate data from the old schema to the new schema.
* Add the proper constraints and indexes to ensure the validity of the data as well as optimize the performance of search queries.
